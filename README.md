# Deep-learning-on-mnist-dataset

This is a small deep learning project that have been performed on mnist dataset.
This code is based on Python and specially convolutional neural networks.


Dataset information:
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.
